        <p>This is my landscape project. This project was a little difficult for me because this was earlier in the semester and I didn't have a full grasp on certain concepts and functions. I did my best to recreate a skyline. The animation is supposed to display a mountain range in the background, with buildings and rocks in the foreground. It also randomly generates the size and positioning of these things upon refreshing.</p>

        <p>This is my time project that is supposed to represent the current time. Originally I had one giant "flower" loop that only modeled elapsed time and not the current time. I went back in and edited the code to create three flowers that generated their animation based on the actual time of day.</p>

        <p>This eyeballs project is an extension from our follower project in class earlier in the semester. I created three eyeballs in resemblance to a character from monsters inc. This project helped me hone in my skills for positioning shapes across the canvas. It was a little tricky thinking about where everything went mathematically.</p>

        <p>This emoji project is an extension from our class's first attempt at creating emojis. My first attempt was a terrible version of a vampire. This attempt displays 3 seals with different colors and positions on the screen.</p>
